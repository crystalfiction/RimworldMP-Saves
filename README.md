# Integrating

1. clone the repo on your system
2. rename the repo folder to 'MpReplays'
3. replace the existing MpReplays directory at your `steamapps/common/RimWorld` 
path (this will replace all MP saves in the directory, make sure you back up 
saves if playing separate games than this one, specifically)


# Syncing

1. save the multiplayer game
2. open up terminal/shell and navigate to same path as above
3. run `git add crystalfiction's game.zip` (or whatever the synced save file 
name is)
4. run `git commit -m <some description>`
5. run `git push`
